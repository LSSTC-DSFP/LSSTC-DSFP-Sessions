    "In this notebook we will introduce some basic concepts related to measuring the flux of a point source. As this is an introduction, several challenges associated with image processing will be ignored or simplified (for example, we will simulate stars in 1 dimension). Nevertheless, the concepts below adapt nicely to charge coupled devices (CCDs) with a small field of view ($\\ll 1\\,\\deg^{2}$), and where stellar crowding is minimal. A good reference for such problems is the [Handbook for CCD Astronomy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006hca..book.....H/abstract) by Steve Howell. However, as we will see throughout this session, the basic methods introduced here are insufficient for an ~all sky survey with a large field-of-view detector, as will be conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We will learn more about those challenges and solutions in later lectures.\n",

This means that *aperture photometry is never better than PSF photometry* despite some claims to contrary in the literature. There are cases where the PSF is extremely difficult to estimate, in which case aperture photometry may be the only decent way to estimate the flux, but even then PSF photometry would be better."
