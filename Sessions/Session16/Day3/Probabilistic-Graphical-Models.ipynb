    "# Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "*By [Adrian Price-Whelan](https://adrian.pw/)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical models are a useful tool for constructing probabilistic models. In one sentence, probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) use concepts from [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) to help represent and conceptualize the complex relationships between random variables in probabilistic models. When visualized as graph diagrams, PGMs are useful for understanding models, for debugging, and for thinking about extensions or generalizations of models. I find them primarily useful for visualization and mapping out a model once I have an idea of how I will write it down, but you can also start thinking about a model in the context of PGMs: I often find logical errors or bugs in code from comparing my ideas about a model, with a PGM representation, with the code that implements a model. Let's dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph theory basics and terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "I am definitely not an expert in graphs or graph theory, but luckily there are only a few key concepts to know before we get on to talking about PGMs in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, what is a *graph*? A graph is a structure that lets us express relationships between pairs of objects that together might belong to a larger, coherent network. A graph is made of *vertices*, which represent the objects, and *edges*, which represent the relationships between objects. The edges in a graph can either have a direction associated with them, or be undirected. These lead to graphs that are either *directed* or *undirected*, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Undirected graphs\n",
    "An example of an *undirected graph* is your network of Facebook friends: When you become friends with someone, they become friends with you. There is no meaning of the \"direction\" of a friendship (well, on Facebook at least). Another example of an undirected graph is a subway or train map. For example, an undirected graph to represent a small section of the NYC subway system is shown below (drawn with [daft](https://docs.daft-pgm.org/)). Here, the vertices or *nodes* of the graph are the subway stations, and train paths or connections are shown as edges."

    "#### Directed graphs\n",
    "*Directed graphs* are useful for representing networks where there are asymmetries between objects / vertices, or where there is an implied directionality in relationships between vertices. One example of a *directed graph* is a family tree: In this case, the vertices are family members and the edges represent relationships (genealogical or adopted) between family members. An example for a family is shown below (again drawn with [daft](https://docs.daft-pgm.org/))."

    "### Problem 4: Inferring the radial velocity of a star from an Echelle spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given an [Echelle spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echelle_grating) for a star and would like to measure the radial velocity of the star. The details aren't critical for this example, but briefly, an Echelle spectrograph splits different sections of a spectrum (in wavelength) into different chunks that land on different parts of the detector, leading to a 2D dispersed spectrum. For example, the below shows a high resolution spectrum of the Sun where each row is a different spectral order:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](echelle_spect.jpg \"echelle spectrum of the Sun\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal now is to write down a graphical model for this inference problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The spectrum is split into $K$ different spectral orders, indexed by $k$. Assume we have extracted the 2D spectrum into $K$ 1D spectra that give us the flux $f_k$ as a function of wavelength $\\lambda_k$ for each spectral order $k$, evaluated on an (oversampled) pixel grid set by the detector. The full arrays of flux and wavelength are $f$ and $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the radial velocity, we will fit for the centroid and widths of all spectral lines assuming they are Gaussian, and the local slope of the spectrum (assuming that the continuum of the spectrum is linear within each order). *Note: these are not great assumptions for working with real data!* Once we get the observed line locations, we can then compare to laboratory values to obtain the radial velocity (i.e. the RV won't appear in this model explicitly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the whole spectrum, there are $M$ spectral lines, indexed by $m$, and each spectral line has a centroid or mean location in wavelength $\\mu_m$ and a standard deviation $\\sigma_m$. The continuum flux in each spectral order $k$ has a slope $a_k$ and an offset $b_k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `daft` package as above, or a sheet of paper, or a whiteboard to draw a graphical model for this model. For tihs problem, there are multiple ways of constructing this PGM, so keep an open mind if you and your group members have different ideas!"

But what if we want to infer the mean distance of an object like a star cluster given a bunch of $N$ parallax measurements $\\varpi$ and uncertainties $\\sigma_\\varpi$ for stars (indexed by $n$) in the cluster? Let's assume that the true line-of-sight distance distribution of this star cluster can be well-approximated as a Gaussian with a mean $\\mu_r$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_r$. This is an example of a simple *hierarchical model*: We need to replace our fixed prior for the stellar distances with a distribution that has its own unknown parameters that we want to learn. In this model, we will want to infer the individual \"true\" distances $r_n$ to each star and also the mean distance and width of the distance distribution (i.e. the size of the cluster).\n",
