## Day 0 – The Beginning | Introduction for the New Cohort

"The story so far: In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."

## Day 1 – Bayes or Bust? | (Probability and Introduction to Bayes)

"On voit, par cet Essai, que la théorie des probabilités n'est, au fond, que le bon sens réduit au calcul."
