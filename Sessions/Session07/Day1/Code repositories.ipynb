    "The notebook contains problems oriented around building a basic Python code repository and making it public via [Github](http://www.github.com).  Of course there are other places to put code repositories, with complexity ranging from services comparable to github to simple hosting a git server on your local machine.  But this focuses on git and github as a ready-to-use example with plenty of additional resources to be found online. \n",

    "Note that these problems assume you are using the Anaconda Python distribution.  This is particular useful for these problems because it makes it very easy to install testing packages in virtual environments quickly and with little wasted disk space. If you are not using anaconda, you can either use an alternative virtual environment scheme (e.g. `pyenv` or `virtualenv`), or just install pacakges directly into your default python (and hope for the best...).\n",

There are a variety of GUI tools that make working with `git` more visually intuitive (e.g. [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com), [gitkraken](http://www.gitkraken.com), or the [github desktop client](https://desktop.github.com)), but this notebook uses the command line tools as the lowest common denominator.  You are welcome to try to reproduce the steps with your client, however - feel free to ask your neighbors or instructors if you run into trouble there.\n",
