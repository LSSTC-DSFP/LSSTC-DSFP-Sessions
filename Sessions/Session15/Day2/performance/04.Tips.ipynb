    "Profiling and optimizing code is a very broad subject, full of rabbit holes. The more you get into it the more you find out how much more you can optmize and how much better your tests could be done. It's also important to understand when to stop.\n",

If you're doing something different like profiling web environment, for example, they might be completely irrelevant and several things might be very different. Use seu bom senso to guess which tips are relevant for each context."
