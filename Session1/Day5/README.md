### Notes

The session on science communication included several group exercises with the students. First, the students were asked to criticize the language and presentation of a popular educational TV show on astronomy. This was followed by a discussion on the importance of building all talks, papers, websites, etc. for a specific audience. Second, Lucianne presented some slides on how to give a good talk. Third, the students were split into pairs to play a game of ["yes, and..."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...) as well as its antithesis "no, but..." Finally, the students split into groups of 4, and were given 30 min to write a 3 min talk, without slides, on something they learned during the first session of the LSSTC DSFP. The groups then reconvened, whereby they took turns (i) presenting their talks and (ii) receiving feedback from the rest of the group on the talk. During the feedback session, those that gave the talk were not allowed to respond, and instead had to simply listen to everything that was said.
