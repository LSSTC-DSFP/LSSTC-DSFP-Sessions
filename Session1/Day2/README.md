### Notes

The Introduction to Advanced Inference and corresponding Bayesian models break-out session largely followed a [previously written Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jakevdp/BayesianAstronomy/blob/master/03-Bayesian-Modeling-With-MCMC.ipynb) by Jake VanderPlas. That notebook served as a portion of a larger [day-long introduction to Bayesian statistics](https://github.com/jakevdp/BayesianAstronomy) taught by Jake.
